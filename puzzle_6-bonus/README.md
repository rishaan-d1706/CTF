# CyDef's Mistake

*This problem is created by Arnav Rustagi*

The code in the Capture-The-Flag event's poster is incorrect! Unfortunately, it seems that the CyDef club has made a huge mistake.

Can you tell us what the exact error is? You need to find out the error code that is thrown when the code is run. What error does the computer see?

*This question has no hints, since it is a bonus*
